## Features

![screenshot](static/screenshots/navbar.png)

This is the main naviation bar for the site. It features the site's logo/name, various product headings for different types of devices on the site, and a heading for the About Us line of pages. It also features a My Account button where users can either register for an account if they don't have one and log in if they do. Logged in users can also find their wishlist here for products they one day want to purchase. here, site administrators can also add products using a form, instead of having to do it through the admin interface. The bag is also located here, where users can see what items they will be checking out with. Finally, we have the search bar in the top middle, which can be used to search for keywords to help users find the product they want effortlessly. Worth a mention is the Free Delivery banner, which may convince users to spend slightly more in order to get free shipping.

![screenshot](static/screenshots/bean-mascot.png)

This is the main landing page of the site, which shows our Bean mascot character in the center as the background to the site, along with a tagline of Refurbished Tech for less and a button inviting customers to Shop Now. This combination of eye catching elements gives the user instant clarity on the site's purpose, friendly and welcoming demeanor, and the most important message of all - they'll be getting a good deal.  

![screenshot](static/screenshots/product-page.png)  
The Products page creates a great user experience in a number of ways. Products are evenly spaced and packed with just enough important information without overloading the user. Clearly displayed is the photo of the product, the starting price and what rating it receives. This gives customers 'green flags' as the important information is provided to you before you've even clicked on a product making customers perceive the site as trustworthy with nothing to hide. Finally, products that are displayed at the current moment can be sorted in a number of ways, such as ratings by High to Low, Low to High, prices by High to Low, Low to High, etc, which enables users to organise the products in a manner that suits them best.  

![screenshot](static/screenshots/product-details.png)  

Here we have the top half of the Product Details page, this page is where the user is brought to when they click on a product to view it. Again, all of the important information is reliably in an obvious and eye catcning place. This page provides a range of functionalities for the user alone. To start, users can pick what condition or quality their refurbished product is. Each quality is associated with it's own price. This gives the user independence in choosing the quality that is right for them, and they could possibly get a bargain as a result. When adding products, users are also able to set the quantity of the item that they are adding to the bag, which is handy for big spenders and increases the likelihood of a purchase due to it's ease of use. Here users can also add the product to their Wishlist. This is a great way of keeping your eye on products you like, possibly to see if they come down in price or purchase them for a special occasion. Whatever the case, it increases the likelihood of purchases in the future.  

![screenshot](static/screenshots/review-form.png)

Near the bottom of the Product Detail page, we can see a list of reviews, and if you're logged in, you'll be able to fill out the form below it to leave one too. This review form increases customer engagement and trust in the site, as they can see other people's experiences and also leave their own. Additionally, logged in users have full CRUD functionality over their reviews, in case they made a typo, or wanted to change their rating, which I will add, dynamically updates the overall rating of the product based on the ratings from contributors as a whole.

![screenshot](static/screenshots/bag-page.png)

The shopping bag page allows users to see what items they have in their bag or 'cart' enabling them to verify again that everything is correct with what they've picked. In case they decide they want more than just one great deal, they can update the quantity of each item in just a click by setting the price and hitting update, or alternatively if they change their mind, they can remove the item as well. Finally, with a Grand Total displayed, and a secure checkout button below, users can be absolutely sure of what they'll be paying, increasing their trust in the system.

![screenshot](static/screenshots/checkout.png)

This is the checkout page, which again iterates the user's order summary and what they will be paying. It is highlighted to the customer that if they proceed, their card will be charged. The form is easy to fill in, and payments are handled securely by Stripe which will increase customer confidence.

![screenshot](static/screenshots/success-page.png)
![screenshot](static/screenshots/success-email.png)

Here we have both the Checkout Success page, and the email that is sent to the customer upon completing their purchase. This makes customers aware of their action and provides them feedback to what they've done. This page shows users every relevant detail of their order, and the email they receive lets them know there is someone they can contact if there is an issue, which increases the trust in the company.

![screenshot](static/screenshots/my-profile.png)

This is the Profile page that you have access to when logged in. Here it will show the details of your latest order such as the date and time, and what you ordered, or you can click the order link to see the same order success for that order with a deeper dive into the order. The default delivery information associated with the account can be updated here, or information you save when you checkout will appear here also, meaning that users will already have this set up automatically unless they opted out of that at the checkout.

![screenshot](static/screenshots/toast.png) 

One of the most important and helpful aspects of the site are the 'Toasts' or little popup messages. These messages let you know nice and clearly what action you've just performed, such as adding or removing to the bag. If customer's bags are below the free delivery threshold, they are notified of these here eye-catchingly, which may increase the chances they may spend a bit more at the site.

![screenshot](static/screenshots/about-us-page.png)
![screenshot](static/screenshots/sustainability-pledge-page.png)
![screenshot](static/screenshots/connect-with-us-page.png)

The three screenshots above show the three different elements to the About Us section of the site, which can be found in the dropdowns when clicking the About us heading in the nav bar. The first is just our company statment outlining our company mission of eco-friendly consumerism. We also have a sustainability pledge where we promise we will plant a tree for every order over $500. On this page, we also have some helpful links to external sites where users can educate themselves further on the benefits of refurbished products. Finally, we have a Connect With Us Page, where users can view our company's Facebook page to help them stay in the loop, and a signup form for our newsletter beside it where users can enroll to get newsletters highlighting the latest deal and potentially exclusive discount codes.

![screenshot](static/screenshots/wishlist-page.png)

This here is a screenshot of the Wishlist page, which is packed with functionality for the user. Here, users can note down products they like or someday want to buy. If they want to view the product details, they can with just a click here, or they can also immediately pick a quality for the product they desire and put one straight in the checkout, ready to buy, without having to go anywhere.

![screenshot](static/screenshots/facebook-page.png)

The Facebook business page is a crucial element of any modern business. It allows us as a company to stay in the loop with current trends and gain valuable market insight, as well as allowing our customers to stay connected through our engaging posts.

## Planning

A number of planning steps were covered to prepare for this project.

### Wireframes

To help visualise the project, and set goals and targets for the functionality of the site, I have created a range of wireframes that cover most aspects of the desired front end of the site. 

![screenshot](static/screenshots/wireframe-products.png)

Similarly to the finished product, this wireframe displays the list of products that will be shown on the site, with product cards displayed in rows, which provides users a clear and well laid out way of browsing products. The sorting selector is also included, which gives users more functionality over the products and how they are displayed, in addition to the device types seen in the nav bar.

![screenshot](static/screenshots/wireframe-product-detail.png)

This wireframe shows the product detail page, with each section clearly seperated so not to overwhelm the user. The page contains all the features you'd need to start understanding what the product could do for you, and the good deal you could get on it.

![screenshot](static/screenshots/wireframe-bag.png)

The wireframe for the bag clearly lays out theplan for the bag, which shows neatly presented information for the customer, making them aware of their purchase and the costs involved, and even lets them up the quantity from the bag directly, if they so desire.

![screenshot](static/screenshots/wireframe-checkout-form.png)

The checkout page wireframe shows two sections, the form for filling out customer delivery details on the left, and the order summary on the right. This seperates the two bits of content so they are clear for the user and easy to understand, and the form securely uses Stripe to handle payments.

![screenshot](static/screenshots/wireframe-connect.png)
![screenshot](static/screenshots/wireframe-about.png)

The wireframes for the About us sections are pretty similar, they both have a photo banner to add some visual content to the page, while still clearly displaying the information within them in an eye catching manner.

![screenshot](static/screenshots/wireframe-wishlist.png)

The Wishlist wireframe, similar to the finished product, allows users the functionality to save products they would like to buy at a later date, whilst also enabling the user to select a quality of the product and add it straight into their bag without having to leave the page or go somewhere else first. If they want to, the user can also view the product's details page to get more information.

### Business model

## User Stories

![screenshot](static/screenshots/user-stories.png)

To plan my User Stories, and cross off checkpoints when I reached the desired functionality for the user, I used Github's Kanban project board. To keep things on track and plan all the way through to a fully functioning site, I gave labels to each story. Two kinds of label were used, one for Sprints, the order in which I would address each user story, and a label to determine the cruciality of the User Story being complete, labelled as Must Have for absolutely required functionality, Should Have for functionality that really should be there, and Could Have, for user stories that are not urgent to give the site purpose and good user experience, but would one day be nice to add.

In the backlog, we have Live Chat Support. This is a Sprint 3, Could Have labelled story.

**As a customer, I can access live chat support so that I can resolve my issues in real-time.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**A live chat widget is available on key pages.**

**Agents can respond to user queries within the dashboard.**

This story has not been started yet, but it could be a good feature to add, especially if the site grows in popularity to help with more user queries.

Currently in progress is Sustainability Metrics. This is another Sprint 3, Could Have labelled story.

**As a customer, I can view the environmental impact of buying refurbished products so that I feel good about making eco-friendly purchases.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Each product page displays estimated CO2 savings compared to buying new.**

**A dashboard summarises the collective environmental impact of purchases.**

**Metrics are sourced from reliable environmental data.**

This story is in progress, as this would be the next feature to be implemented on the site. It would be very beneficial for users to see how their purchase is helping the planet, as it is one of the main focusses of the business as a whole, and its something we think our users should be celebrated for, so why not give them the satisfaction of seeing how they are making a difference.
