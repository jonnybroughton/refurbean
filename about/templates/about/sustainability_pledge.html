        <h2>Sustainability Pledge</h2>
        <p>At Refurbean, sustainability is at the core of everything we do. 
           As a company specialising in refurbished technology, we 
           are committed to reducing electronic waste, conserving 
           resources, and helping protect the environment. We believe 
           that technology should not only enhance lives but also contribute 
           to a cleaner, greener future. By offering high-quality refurbished 
           devices, we ensure that products stay in use for longer, helping 
           to reduce the demand for new electronics and decrease harmful 
           waste that ends up in landfills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our commitment to sustainability goes beyond just selling 
            refurbished products. We actively work to minimise our carbon 
            footprint across all operations. From sourcing eco-friendly 
            packaging materials to collaborating with suppliers who share 
            our values, we are constantly evaluating and improving our 
            processes to ensure they align with our environmental goals. 
            We are also dedicated to educating our customers about the 
            benefits of choosing refurbished tech, encouraging them to 
            make more sustainable choices in their own lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of our ongoing efforts to make a positive 
            environmental impact, <strong>we have partnered with environmental 
            organisations to plant trees for every order over $500.</strong> 
            For each qualifying purchase, we will plant a tree in a reforestation 
            project, helping to combat deforestation and contribute to the 
            restoration of vital ecosystems. This initiative is just one of 
            the ways we can give back to the planet and help create a 
            greener, healthier world for future generations.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Refurbean, we understand that sustainability is a journey, 
            and we are committed to doing our part. From our operations to 
            the products we sell, we strive to make choices that benefit both 
            people and the planet. Our pledge is to continue improving our practices 
            and making it easier for our customers to make environmentally conscious 
            decisions. Together, we can make a significant difference and build a 
            more sustainable future, one device and one tree at a time.
